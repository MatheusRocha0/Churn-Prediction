In this project I build a Machine Learning model with 99% of accuracy able to predict whether a customer is going to stop buying from a company and also analyse the dataset to find out what to do when we detect it.

The model was deployed using Streamlit on Heroku, to access the interface just check this link: https://bit.ly/2Q6xLnw
